Ideation 

Possible Issues: getting dealt a bad hand (often) 

Fix:  

a) Allow a “mulligan” for the initial deal 

Let the player redeal their hand once per round if they really hate their cards. 

To preserve fairness: 

Limit it to once per game or once per X rounds. 

a) Weighted or pseudo-random dealing 

Instead of purely uniform shuffling: 

Detect extremely poor hands (<2 possible 15s, no runs, no pairs). 

Allow a reshuffle only in edge cases.
